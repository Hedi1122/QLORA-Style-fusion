StyleFusion-LoRA

Parameter-Efficient Multi-Style Text Generation with LoRA on T5

StyleFusion-LoRA is a research project exploring parameter-efficient style transfer and style composition for text generation using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a frozen T5-Small model.
The system enables independent training of style-specific adapters (poetic, legal, journalistic) and dynamic style mixing at inference time without retraining the base model.
